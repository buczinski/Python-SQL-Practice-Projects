    "1001-Experiments currently has the following four datasets with four months of data:\n",
    " - \"user_health_data.csv\" which logs daily health metrics, habits and data from wearable devices,\n",
    " - \"supplement_usage.csv\" which records details on supplement intake per user,\n",
    " - \"experiments.csv\" which contains metadata on experiments, and\n",
    " - \"user_profiles.csv\" which contains demographic and contact information of the users.\n",
    "\n",
    "Each dataset contains unique identifiers for users and/or their supplement regimen.\n",
    "\n",
    "The developers and data scientsits currently manage code that cross-references all of these data sources separately, which is cumbersome and error-prone.\n",
    "\n",
    "Your manager has asked you to write a Python function that cleans and merges these datasets into a single dataset.\n",
    "\n",
    "The final dataset should provide a comprehensive view of each user's health metrics, supplement usage, and demographic information.\n",
    "\n",
    "- To test your code, your manager will run only the code `merge_all_data('user_health_data.csv', 'supplement_usage.csv', 'experiments.csv', 'user_profiles.csv')`\n",
    "- Your `merge_all_data` function must return a DataFrame, with columns as described below.\n",
